# K-means-Clustering

run from ex7

Apply K-means algorithm for image compression. Starts with 2D dataset to 
gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. 
Then K-means algorithm is used for image compression by reducing
the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most
common in that image.
